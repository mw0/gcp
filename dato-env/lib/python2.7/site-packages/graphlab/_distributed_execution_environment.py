def set_distributed_execution_environment(environment, timeout_in_seconds=600):
    '''
    Change default execution environment to be a Dato Distributed cluster. After this
    method is called, operations like SFrame, SArray, SGraph and model training
    may perform in the given Distributed Cluster.

    The Cluster object may be a Hadoop Cluster or EC2 Cluster. For EC2 Cluster, the
    cluster must have been started using:

        >>> cluster = gl.deploy.ec2_cluster.create(...)

    Or if the EC2 Cluster is already launched, it may be retrieved through:

        >>> cluster = gl.deploy.ec2_cluster.load(...)

    For Hadoop Cluster, the cluster must have been installed into your Hadoop
    system, and the appropriate path to a HDFS needs to be provided to load the
    cluster into GraphLab Create:

        >>> cluster = gl.deploy.hadoop_cluster.create(...)

    If the Hadoop Cluster execution environment has been created and saved before,
    it can be loaded by:

        >>> cluster = gl.deploy.hadoop_cluster.load(...)

    Parameters
    -----------

    environment : HadoopCluster | Ec2Cluster (Coming soon)
        This can be either a EC2 Cluster or Hadoop Cluster object

    timeout_in_seconds : int, optional
        Timeout in seconds. The execution environment will shutdown automatically if
        it is in idle for given timeout. If not given, the default value is 10
        minutes (600 seconds). After the execution environment is timed out, it will
        automatically be spinned up again next time you submit job.
