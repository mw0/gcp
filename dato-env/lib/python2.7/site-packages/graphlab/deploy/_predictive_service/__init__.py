"""
Predictive Services provide an easy way for users to turn one or more GraphLab
Create models into a cloud service that can be used to provide predictions or
recommendatations to customer applications.
"""

# We keep track of Predictive Service and Predicitve Object schema version here.
# The way to evolve them is:
# * If Predictive Service schema changes, but Predictive Object schema does not
#   need to change, PREDICTIVE_SERVICE_SCHEMA_VERSION is increased by 1, but
#   PREDICTIVE_OBJECT_SCHEMA_VERSION stays the same.
# * If Predictive Object schema changes, then both Predictive Service and
#   Predictive Object version are bumped up to be PREDICTIVE_SERVICE_SCHEMA_VERSION
#   plus one

# This scheme allows the following:
# *  A Predictive Service with version Vs can always load Predictive Service with
#    version less than or equal to Vs, it will fail otherwise
# *  A Predictive Service with version Vs can always load Predictive Objects with
#    version less than or equal to Vs, it will fail otherwise

# PREDICTIVE OBJECT SCHEMA CHANGES:
'''
v0: Save Predict Object along with dependent GraphLab objects in a zipped file.
    User can only add dependent GraphLab from a python object. (VERSION 1)
v1: Save predictive object definition (query) and dependencies (GraphLab objects)
    separatedly. GraphLab objects are stored in its original format (not compressed)
    in a separate folder provided during save. Support adding dependent GraphLab
    objects from uri (http, s3, local path, etc.) (VERSION 1)
v2: Save Predictive Object along with dependent GraphLab objects in a zipped file.
    All GraphLab objects are pickled together with the query definition. (VERSION 2)
v3: Now saving Predictive Objects as directories with non-GL objects zipped for
    performance. (VERSION 3)
v4: Change Predicitve Service to use docker, as a result, the AMI image, the
    user_data passed and the items stored in state.ini(Execution Environment)
    section are changed. Port that the server listens on is also configurable now,
    so it is an optional parameter in state.ini.
