- Real-time querying and consumption of predictive objects (i.e. models) with
  GraphLab Create Predictive Services.

    Decorator to annotate the set of packages required for executing a function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    packages: list[str]
        A list that specifies all required python packages current function uses.
        The dependencies are specified in the format of distutils, like:

    ----------
    A decorator specialized for required_packages.

    Examples
    --------

def required_files(files, pattern='*'):
    ''' Packages the dependent file(s) for remote execution.

    Package required files for remote execution. This ensures that code written
    locally can safely run in remote environments. The files will be packaged
    and shipped to the remote execution environment. The files will be laid
    out in the same directory structure, in the remote machine, as was present
    in the current working directory.

    Parameters
    -----------
    files : list[str] | str
        Files can be one of the following types:

        - If 'files' is a string and points to a directory, then all files under
          the directory with the given pattern will be shipped.
        - If 'files' is a string and points to a file, the only the one file is
          shipped, pattern will be ignored.
        - If 'files' is a list of string, then we treat them as a set of files to
          be shipped.

    pattern: str
        The file name pattern, it is used as a filter to filter out files that
        are not needed.

    See Also
    --------
    required_packages

    Examples
    --------

        To include all files in a given directory.

        .. sourcecode:: python

          @required_files('my_module_directory_name', pattern='*.py')
          def my_function(input):
              # my logic
              return output

        To include a list of files required by the function.

        .. sourcecode:: python

          @required_files(['file1.py', 'file2.py'])
          def my_function(input):

    Notes
    ------
    - Note that all files are going to be recorded as a relative path to the
      current working directory. When shipped to remote machine, the files
      are going to be laid out in exactly the same structure as in your folder.
