"""
The GraphLab Create nearest neighbors toolkit is used to find the rows in a data table
that are most similar to a query row.

Finding nearest neighbors is a two-stage process, analogous to many other
GraphLab Create toolkits. First a
:py:class:`~graphlab.nearest_neighbors.NearestNeighborsModel` is created, using
a reference dataset contained in an :class:`~graphlab.SFrame`. Then this model
is queried to find the nearest reference data points to a set of new query
points, also stored in an SFrame.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> references = graphlab.SFrame({'feature1': [0.98, 0.62, 0.11],
    ...                               'feature2': [0.69, 0.58, 0.36]})
    >>> references = references.add_row_number(column_name='id')
    >>> model = graphlab.nearest_neighbors.create(references, label='id')

    >>> queries = graphlab.SFrame({'feature1': [0.05, 0.61, 0.99],
    ...                            'feature2': [0.06, 0.97, 0.86]})
    >>> queries = queries.add_row_number(column_name='id')    
    >>> model.query(queries, label='id', k=2)
